        <div className="w-full space-y-4 mt-4">
          <p>
            I am an undergraduate student of Computer Science and Engineering at
            BUET, with a passion for solving complex problems and a drive to
            achieve excellence in everything I do. My academic journey has
            equipped me with a strong foundation in various languages like
            Python, Java, and C++, while my hands-on experience includes working
            with technologies like React, Next.js, and MongoDB for web
            development.
          </p>

          <p>
            I am particularly fascinated by the fields of AI and machine
            learning. I am deeply committed to making a positive impact on
            society and the environment, using my skills and knowledge to
            contribute to meaningful and sustainable change.
          </p>

          <p>
            I am always keen to develop myself, continuously learning and
            adapting to new technologies to stay up-to-date in this
            ever-evolving field. I thrive in environments where I can tackle
            challenging tasks, optimize processes for efficiency, and
            collaborate with others to create impactful solutions. Whether itâ€™s
            managing multiple tasks simultaneously or working as part of a team,
            I am committed to delivering top-quality work and pushing the
            boundaries of what's possible in the tech world.
